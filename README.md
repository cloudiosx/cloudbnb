### Features ###

* Sign-up and login with credentials
* Easy to use interface
* Logged in user can create Home Listings
* Logged in user can create Reviews
* Logged in user can edit/delete their own Home Listings
* Logged in user can edit/delete their own Reviews

### Technical Details ###
* One challenge I faced was handling how the logic for the "review" feature works. The review had to have the ability to be displayed on the browser's re-render, meaning that creating, editing, or deleting a review on a Home Listing should not cause the page to reload.
